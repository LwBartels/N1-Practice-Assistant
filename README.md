# N1-Practice-Assistant
A program that lets you practice knowledge in sentence structures, mixed alphabet, and characters (Kanji) in preparation for the N1 JLPT Test

Project Title: Japanese Learning Assistant
Overview
The Japanese Learning Assistant is an educational tool designed to help me with practicing and improving my Japanese language skills, particularly focusing on the mastery of Hiragana, Katakana, and N1 level Kanji characters. The application tries to also make a user-friendly, interactive experience, allowing users to engage in various practice activities through a command-line interface.
Features
Hiragana and Katakana Practice: Users can practice writing sentences in both Hirgana and Katakana. The application translates user-inputted Romaji (Latin script) into the corresponding Japanese script. Users specify the script type (Hiragana or Katakana) at the beginning of their input for accurate translation. Mixed Script Practice: A unique feature that enables users to practice sentences with a mixture of Hiragana and Katakana scripts. The application intelligently identifies and translates parts of the sentence into the appropriate script based on user-indicated brackets. N1 Kanji Test: A testing feature for users to challenge their knowledge of N1 level Kanji. The application randomly selects a Kanji character and prompts the user to input its Romaji and English equivalent. Immediate feedback is provided, indicating whetherthe user's answer is correct or incorrect. Interactive Command-Line Interface: A simple, interactive interface allows users to choose their desired practice activity. The interface guides users through the available options and captures their choices for the subsequent practice session. User Input Validation: The application includes input validation to guide users correctly through the practice sessions. It prompts uses to adhere to the input format required for each practice type. Technical Details
The project is implemented in Python, utilizing its standard libraries. Key functionalities re encapsulated within separate classes (Hiragna, Katakana, N1KanjiList), following the principles of object-oriented programming. User interactions are handled thrugh standard input and output (console), making the application compatible with basic command-line interfaces.
